# Mastering SQL: Your Essential Guide for Data EDA and ETL

## Introduction

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for managing and manipulating data in relational databases. However, understanding and exploring data, known as exploratory data analysis (EDA), is equally crucial. After extracting and cleaning data, the next step is to explore it to gain business insights. This guide focuses on the process of exploring and understanding data using SQL.

## Understanding SQL Clauses

SQL queries typically involve several clauses:

SELECT: Specifies the columns of interest.
FROM: Specifies the table where the data resides.
WHERE: Filters data based on certain conditions.
GROUP BY: Aggregates data based on specified columns.
HAVING: Filters aggregated data.
ORDER BY: Sorts results based on specified columns.
LIMIT: Specifies the maximum number of rows in the result set.

## Getting Data into SQL Server

Data can be imported into SQL Server or manually inserted into tables. Importing data involves creating a database (if necessary) and importing data into it. For this project, a database named "Portfolio" was created, and a retail dataset with six columns was imported into it.

## EDA Exploratory: Preparing the Data for Analysis

EDA involves iterative steps of data cleaning and exploration. The process typically includes:

Calling up the imported tables: Selecting all columns from the imported table.
Preparing the dataset for analysis: Creating a new table and removing null values from specific columns.
Adding a new column: Altering the table structure to include a new column for revenue calculation.
Removing unwanted symbols and commas: Cleaning price and quantity columns.
Analyzing outliers using Z-score: Identifying potential outliers based on Z-scores.
Aggregating data: Summarizing data using aggregators like SUM() and COUNT().
Ordering results: Organizing results based on specified columns.
Showing top customers: Displaying top customers based on quantity and revenue.

## Conclusion

SQL is indispensable for anyone working with data and databases. This guide provides fundamental concepts for navigating relational databases, extracting insights, and manipulating data efficiently. Practice is key to mastering SQL, and this guide serves as a reference for various SQL functions and concepts.
